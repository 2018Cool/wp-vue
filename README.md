# WP Vue

This is just a simple Vue blog that displays posts from a WordPress REST API endpoint. Clone or fork this sucka & rip it apart to suit your own needs. If you have ideas to make it better for everyone else, contribute!

## Install

1. Make sure you have `yarn` installed on your machine, and run `yarn install`.
